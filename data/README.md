# Dataset

1. Data Folder: This folder contains the data for taxi rides in the month of December and year 2016. This data was collected from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-taxi-rides-2016). This dataset includes taxi trips for 2016, reported to the City of Chicago in its role as a regulatory agency. To protect privacy but allow for aggregate analyses, the Taxi ID is consistent for any given taxi medallion number but does not show the number, Census Tracts are suppressed in some cases, and times are rounded to the nearest 15 minutes. Due to the data reporting process, not all trips are reported but the City believes that most are. See http://digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/chicago-taxi-data-released for more information about this dataset and how it was created.

2. Extra Information Folder: This folder contains extra details like the list of all columns and the meaning of each of them. It also contains the data required to map the values of latitude and longitude to their actual values.

3. CleanedDataset Folder: This folder contains the cleaned data which is used for the respective experiments.
